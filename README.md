<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h4>This is my first project using C++ language . It consists of algorithm to solve the sudoku puzzle and Snake and Ladder game . It simply uses the concept of backtracking and Graph Traversals.</h4>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<h4>As we all know that Sudoku is a very popular puzzle game . In this game we are given a 9x9 grid , some of its cell maybe empty or maybe filled and we have to fill this existing grid in such a way that in each column and each row a number must not be appear more than once .</h4>
<h4>In this algorithm , we assume that if a cell is empty in the begining than we take zero as a input from user otherwise the input should be same as the existing number .   </h4>
<h4>This algorithm uses the concept of backtracking . While writing this algorithm we used data structures, use of boolean functions , void functions etc. Also if there doesnt exist any solution of this puzzle the compiler will show NO SOLUTION EXISTS .</h4>

<h4>Also we know the Snake and ladder game in which we have to reach the final point . </h4>
<h4>In that algorithm we used the concept of Breadth First Search to reach the final point in minimum possible steps . Also we used the concepts of Directed Graphs as well.</h4>

<h3>Looking forward to make a proper Sudoku game and Snake and Ladder game using Android Development . </h3>
